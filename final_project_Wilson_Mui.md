# Outline
My final project will be an infographic webpage (i.e. shorthand) that will attempt to do 3 things:
(1) Garner support for interest in an MDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy clinic in Pittsburgh.
(2) Demand action from public officials to assist in working with the FDA to bring this to Pittsburgh
(3) Get support (financial, or social) for the MAPS (Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies) Organization.

I will focus on the first objective, and then give the audience an easy way to reach their local officials or MAPS as the secondary objective.

My narrative arc will be as follows (Using the tools available to Shorthand):
- Dramatic Title: "MDMA : (Rick Doblin quote about MDMA access)"
- Address negative biases to MDMA - "Some people know it as ecstasy or 'molly'..."
- But it wasn't always illegal...it was made illegal in the 80's, and before that it was used in therapy...
- What we're finding out now is that MDMA can be incredibly effective for treating MDMA
  (Have timeline viz-graphic pinpointing Rick Doblin's work towards legalization
  (perhaps have link of interiview clip of Ethan Nadelmann talking about drugs and MDMA revolution)
  
- Lead up to current status, Phase III FDA trials
- Explain results (see MAPS Investigator's Brochure for statistics)
- Who can benefit...Veterans...
  (Show graphic of veterans data - Pennsylvania has 4th highest veterans population)
  (Show graphic of veteran suicide)
  
- Explain locations where trials are being done right now (8 cities)
  (use geographic graphic to highlight city locations)
  
- Explain how Pittsburgh can be an "Expanded Access Site"

- Include link of movie clip of people who have been apart of the Phase II trials

- Give links to politicians and MAPS, and newsletter sign up

# Method and Medium
Shorthand - As the main story telling framework
[Shorthand sketch](https://github.com/Wilson-Mui/viz-portfolio/blob/aa496e97256b879967e34d34ef34353d2d652b18/IMG_20190210_215636.jpg)
      


Geographic data visualization (to show MDMA trial clinics across the country, and some information about those sites)

Timeline data visualization (to show the work Rick Doblin has done and the different steps along the way, and victories)

pie charts/bar charts to show the success rate of people who've tried MDMA and had improvements in PTSD symptoms

iconographics to showcase the trial size so far (1,700 participants overall).
