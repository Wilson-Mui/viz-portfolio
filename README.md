This is my public portfolio for the Telling Stories with Data class at CMU

# About me
I'm a Masters of Public Policy and Management student at Carnegie Mellon Heinz College (2019).

I have a B.S. in Physics from Harvey Mudd College and have had a career in engineering, IT, and finance. Now my focus is to use data analytics to shape public policy. My area of interest is in drug policy, especially as it relates to crime, addiction, and mental health treatment. Simply put, I want to change our country's relationship to drugs.

# What I hope to learn
I'm hoping to learn cutting edge visualization tools that I can use to enhance my ability to reshape the narrative around drugs and drug policy. To shape policy you have to be able to frame a compelling narrative to policy makers, and facts alone are often not enough. Facts must be packaged in a digestible format that summarises the main ideas and is displayed in a way that resonates with your audience.

I would like to expand my toolset to be able to make more compelling visualizations of data. This will help me tell a story about the history of drugs, our current relationship with drugs, and how I see that relationship in the future. I also hope to learn the subtleties of data visualization - from color choice, to font type, to chart type - that makes some visualisations more effective than others.
